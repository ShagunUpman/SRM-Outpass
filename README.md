# SRM-Outpass

Request Outing is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web app that replicates the SRM hostel outing request system using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows students to submit outing requests, view their outing status, and receive a unique OTP for gate verification. The form auto-locks after submission to prevent duplicates and displays details like Handled On and Handled By for a realistic workflow. All data is stored locally using browser session storage, making it simple, responsive, and completely backend-free.
